# Introduction
Every student on campus has at some point or another boarded the BT Transport bus only to find that its completely packed, despite the app saying otherwise. Bus drivers in the current system are required to manually keep track of current passengers, but this system is primitive and flawed. Human error can lead to invalid and incorrect data which brings harm to not only the BT system, but also the passengers who ride and utilize their services. In order to solve this problem, our team has recreated the results from the paper "Estimating Bus Cross-Sectional Flow Based on Machine Learning Algorithm Combined with Wi-Fi Probe Technology" [1] generated by utilizing machine learning to analyze wifi data in order to estimate the current number of passengers on a bus.

# Summary of the Original Paper
The original paper "Estimating Bus Cross-Sectional Flow Based on Machine Learning Algorithm Combined with Wi-Fi Probe Technology" by Ting-Zhao Chen, Yan-Yan Chen, and Jian-Hui Lai sought to create a machine algorithm that would estimate the amount of passengers inside a bus based on device wifi signals. This was done by placing 4 probes around the bus and estimating data received to predict bus capacity. However, a large portion of the paper primarily focused on determining which machine learning algorithm had the greatest accuracy. The team tested Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine. Each algorithm was fed the same feature vector: RRSI_AVG, RSSI_SUM, RSSI_ST, C_T, and M_AVG. These features are the average signal strength, the total sum of the signal strength, the standard deviation of the signal pool, the amount of times each signal was detected, and the average number of signals detected. The paper determined that Random Forest was the most accurate algorithm for the bus capacity problem. Additionally, they found that specifically for KNN, a K value of 8 was the most accurate.

# Our Method
The purpose of our project was to replicate the experiment conducted by the paper. However various changes were made to their methods. First we instead analyzed and collected bluetooth signals over wifi. This was because our device, an esp-32, worked best with bluetooth signals. These signals were collected every 2 seconds and then the data was converted into bundles of 20 second intervals. This was because the component vector used by the paper analyzed in batches of times. Additionally, we changed the feature vector to instead break down C_T into 4 separate values. Each C_T would record how many devices were found for a certain length of time. The first covering 0-5 seconds, the second covering 5-10 seconds, etc. The actual collection of the data was done by taking the esp-32 into a vehicle and driving a route similar to a bus. We varied the number of passengers in the vehicle and drove to densly populated areas. This data was then fed into 3 algorithms: KNN, RF, and SVM similarly to the paper. We then analyzed these results and compared them to the original paper.
