# Introduction
Every student on campus has at some point or another boarded the BT Transport bus only to find that its completely packed, despite the app saying otherwise. Bus drivers in the current system are required to manually keep track of current passengers, but this system is primitive and flawed. Human error can lead to invalid and incorrect data which brings harm to not only the BT system, but also the passengers who ride and utilize their services. In order to solve this problem, our team has recreated the results from the paper "Estimating Bus Cross-Sectional Flow Based on Machine Learning Algorithm Combined with Wi-Fi Probe Technology" [1] generated by utilizing machine learning to analyze wifi data in order to estimate the current number of passengers on a bus.
